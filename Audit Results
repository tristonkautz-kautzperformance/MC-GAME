Audit Results

Scope
-----
- Core loop: input -> player -> world -> renderer -> HUD.
- Focus: correctness risks, perf traps, scaling constraints, regressions.

Findings (ordered by severity)
------------------------------
- Medium: Renderer draw loops iterate `pairs(self._chunkMeshes)` twice per frame (opaque then alpha) and allocate a new forward vector each draw; OK now, but scales poorly as chunk count grows. See `src/render/ChunkRenderer.lua:701`.
- Medium: Alpha meshes (leaves) are drawn in arbitrary table iteration order (not depth-sorted), which will produce blending artifacts as more translucent content is added. See `src/render/ChunkRenderer.lua:723`.
- Low: HUD allocates vectors and rebuilds a concatenated text block every frame; currently fine, but it adds per-frame allocation noise if you later chase micro-stutter. See `src/ui/HUD.lua:23` and `src/ui/HUD.lua:36`.
- Low/Design: Breaking a block always removes it; if inventory is full the block effectively disappears (no drop). Decide whether this is intended. See `src/interaction/Interaction.lua:21`.
- Scaling note: Rebuild prioritization rebuckets queued dirty entries when the player changes chunk; this is O(queue) and can be noticeable if the dirty backlog becomes large. See `src/render/ChunkRenderer.lua:92` and `src/render/ChunkRenderer.lua:236`.

Resolved
--------
- Git is now initialized correctly in this working directory:
  - Preserved the broken `.git` folder as `.git_incomplete_backup_2026-02-10/` for safety.
  - Initialized a new repository on `main`, added a `.gitignore` for local artifacts/backups, and pushed to GitHub (`tristonkautz-kautzperformance/MC-GAME`).
- Base terrain generation no longer calls `ChunkWorld:set()` for every voxel; it writes directly into chunk storage and marks chunks dirty once at the end. See `src/world/ChunkWorld.lua:163`.
- AIR storage bloat addressed: writing AIR clears chunk slots (`nil`) to keep chunk data sparse as blocks are broken/placed. See `src/world/Chunk.lua:21`.
- Removed idle per-frame dirty-key list allocations:
  - Added `ChunkWorld:drainDirtyChunkKeys(out)` and a shared-empty fast path in `ChunkWorld:getDirtyChunkKeys()`. See `src/world/ChunkWorld.lua:5`.
  - Renderer now drains into a reusable scratch array and queues using an explicit count. See `src/render/ChunkRenderer.lua:41`.
